# Brew

`brew list`: Shows packages installed via homebrew.

`brew list --versions`: Shows packages also with their versions.

`brew list --cask`: Shows installed via Homebrew Cask.

`brew leaves`: Shows only the packages you installed manually, not the dependencies pulled automatically.

`brew bundle dump`: To create a Brewfile that lists all your installed packages, which is handy for migrating to a new Mac.
